	Mid_Production_time_Trailer: (normal) time units that a trailer need to produce
	Mid_Production_time_MHU: (normal) time units that a MHU need to produce	
	Mid_Production_time_Kit: (normal) time units that a kit-of-part need to produce
	Low_Production_time_Trailer: (optimistic) time units that a trailer need to produce (0.5 * Mid_Production_time_Trailer)
	Low_Production_time_MHU: (optimistic) time units that a MHU need to produce (0.5 * Mid_Production_time_MHU)
	Low_Production_time_Kit: (optimistic) time units that a kit-of-part need to produce (0.5 * Mid_Production_time_Kit)
	Num_Production_Line: number of production line the supplier has 
	Extra_Num_Production_Line: extra number of production line opened for the supplier in emergency modality (2 * Num_Production_Line)	
	High_Flow_Limitation_per_Unit: units of house can be delivered in a time unit from the supplier 
				      (Initial_Inventory_Aavg_trailer + High_Production_time_MHU + High_Production_time_Kit) * 0.5
	Mid_Flow_Limitation_per_Unit: units of house can be delivered in a time unit from the supplier

Mismatch_Penalty:
	              |   groupd of victims
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	type of house |   factor of mismatch penalty cost
		      |   (that is, factor * price of house = penalty cost)

Group_Preference:
		      |   groupd of victims
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	type of house |   Preference order (First) 1 → 2 → 3 → ...


Unmet_Penalty:
	Factor: factor of unmet penalty cost (that is, factor * price of the first preference house = unmet penalty cost)

Unused_Inventory_Penalty: 
	Factor: factor of unused penalty cost (that is, factor * price of the house = unused inventory penalty cost)

Deprivation_Penalty:
	Deprivation penalty cost is a function of time t. Thus a_0e^{a_1t}.
